                    <h3>Project 1: Totally Manageable New Tavern</h3>
                    <p>I was responsible for creating the story and implementing the code created by one of my partners in order to make the skeleton structure of the code operate as we had intended. I also used loops in order to give the player many different options for navigation while they were playing the game. We also were ready to implement different weapons and armor and more combat options in general, but we ran out of time before we could fully test it.</p>

                    <h3>Project 2: The Wildie West</h3>
                    <p>I have been responsible for interviewing guests as well as set up and tear down of remote studios in order to get all of the recoring need for the podcast. I have also done a little bit of video and sound editing, as well as script editing for the podcast in order to make the script sound more fluid and conversational. Chase has spent more time on this project than any other he has been a part of, and is actually seeing a ton of success with it, hoping to even get monetized by the start of next season in January of next year.</p>
