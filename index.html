                    <h3>Project 1: Totally Manageable New Tavern</h3>
                    <p>I was responsible for creating the story and implementing the code created by one of my partners in order to make the skeleton structure of the code operate as we had intended. I also used loops in order to give the player many different options for navigation while they were playing the game. We also were ready to implement different weapons and armor and more combat options in general, but we ran out of time before we could fully test it.</p>

                    <h3>Project 2: The Wildie West</h3>
                    <p>I have been responsible for interviewing guests as well as set up and tear down of remote studios in order to get all of the recoring need for the podcast. I have also done a little bit of video and sound editing, as well as script editing for the podcast in order to make the script sound more fluid and conversational. Chase has spent more time on this project than any other he has been a part of, and is actually seeing a ton of success with it, hoping to even get monetized by the start of next season in January of next year.</p>

                    <h3>Experience 1: Klondike Rib and Salmon</h3>
                    <p>My favourite job i've ever worked, Klondike Rib and Salmon is small restaurant in the heart of the yukon. The building itself is over 100 years old and has been passed down to different families throughout its lifetime. In the summer after I graduated from highschool
                        I started working at Klondike Rib and Salmon as both a dishwasher and prep coook. The restaurant is seasonal and a tourist attraction, making every waking moment of working their a put you into  astate of panic with how busy it is. which was honestly my favourite part, since I always had something to do.
                        I learned to work under pressure and made amazing friends during my time at Klondike Rib and Salmon and definitely hope to go back there sometime in the future, even if its just for a single summer.

                    <h3>Experience 2: Dog Training</h3>
                    <p>My Mom is a professional dog trainer who spent multiple years in different European countries, such as Hungary, learning everything there is to know about dog training. Since its such a big part of her life, it became a small part of mine as well since I've been surrounded by it since I was born. 
                        I've won several dog shows over the years, especially when I was younger and had less of my own things going on. Now, while I'm currently focusing on programming I still occasionally go to dog shows with my Mom and help her when training her dogs and taking care of other peoples dogs.
