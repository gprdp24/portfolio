							For this project, my role was to design and

							game using Tkinter. I created interactive windows
							that allowed the user to navigate through the game's
							story by selecting from various available options.
							The use of loops, lists, dicts were implemented
							along with error handling using try-except blocks to
							manage invalid inputs gracefully and ensure a smooth

						<h3>Project 1: Bulldog Capstone</h3>
						<p>
							During my last year of highschool, I was required to do a capstone project with a topic of my choosing.
							I decided on deepening my understanding of dog training and spent a month in Red Deertraining a french Bulldog
							named buffy. By the end, Buffy had learned most basic obedience skills such as walking properly on a leash, staying 
							on her bed when asked too and not getting distracted by passerby dogs and people.

						<h3>Experience 1: Klondike Rib and Salmon</h3>
						<p>
							My first real job, I spent the summer of 2024 working at Klondike Rib and Salmon as a prep cook and dishwasher, an infamous restuarant in the yukon
							passed down for over 100 years, and one of the oldest buildings left in the yukon. Working at Klondike rib and Salmon
							is one of my favourite things i've ever done as it was both fun and put good experience under my belt.
