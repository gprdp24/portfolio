						<h3>Project 1:Totally Manageable New Tavern</h3>
						<p>
							For this project, my role was to design and
							implement the graphical user interface (GUI) for the
							game using Tkinter. I created interactive windows
							that allowed the user to navigate through the game's
							story by selecting from various available options.
							The use of loops, lists, dicts were implemented
							along with error handling using try-except blocks to
							manage invalid inputs gracefully and ensure a smooth
							gameplay experience

						<h3>Project 2: Password Manager Keeper</h3>
						<p>
							With HTML, CSS, and JS self self-learning I
							developed a card counting web app, which would count
							cards to win in Blackjack. Radio buttons for the
							number of decks being used, then the user would
							input the cards delt to himself and the dealer. With
							JavaScript I developed algorithms to count the cards
							and let the user know when to up or down their bet.
							It was meant for people who know at least the basic
							strategy for playing Blackjack.

						<h3>Project 1: Totally Manageable New Tavern</h3>
						<p>
							I was responsible for creating the story and
							implementing the code created by one of my partners
							in order to make the skeleton structure of the code
							operate as we had intended. I also used loops in
							order to give the player many different options for
							navigation while they were playing the game. We also
							were ready to implement different weapons and armor
							and more combat options in general, but we ran out
							of time before we could fully test it.

						<h3>Project 2: The Wildie West</h3>
						<p>
							I have been responsible for interviewing guests as
							well as set up and tear down of remote studios in
							order to get all of the recoring need for the
							podcast. I have also done a little bit of video and
							sound editing, as well as script editing for the
							podcast in order to make the script sound more fluid
							and conversational. Chase has spent more time on
							this project than any other he has been a part of,
							and is actually seeing a ton of success with it,
							hoping to even get monetized by the start of next
							season in January of next year.
